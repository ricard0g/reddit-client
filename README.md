# Reddit Client

---

## Description

This is a simplified Reddit clone created to enhance and improve my React-Redux skills.

This clone allows you to see information retrieved from the [Reddit JSON API](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/JSON), I'm using the Reddit JSON API instead of the official API because it doesn't require the OAuth process, allowing any user to play without registering.


## Technologies Used

Simple web app created with [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/).

On the other hand it includes [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for state management at a global level.


## Installation

Before cloning and installing the project on your device make sure that you have the latest npm version. Run this command on your terminal to check which version you have:
`npm -v`

If you don't have the latest version run this command:

`npm install -g npm@latest`

You may have to include *sudo* before the command if you are on a Unix-based system and don't have root privileges.


### Usage

Due to the simplicity of the app, you can basically search and see reddit content. 

Hope you love the experience!
